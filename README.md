## Integration Details

This library:
- Internally utilizes the `lucide-static` package for icon definitions.
- Includes `ILucideIconData` for icon data encapsulation, providing structured interfaces for SVG manipulation.
- Supports additional data manipulation for expanding sources via the `AdditionalSourcesCollection` class.

### Dependencies
- [Lucide-Static](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lucide-static) for icon SVG content.
- **CodeOfChaos.GeneratorTools** for generator tooling in source generation scenarios.

### Supported Platforms
- **.NET 9.0** Blazor Server and WebAssembly.

## Development Notes

This project follows a modular structure for maintainability:
- `InfiniLore.Lucide`: Blazor components and view logic.
- `InfiniLore.Lucide.Data`: Handles icon definitions and metadata.
- `InfiniLore.Lucide.Generators`: Implements tooling via Roslyn to read data from lucide.static package.
